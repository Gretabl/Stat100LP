The purpose of our project is to see what variables make a "good" society by using the Human Development Index and the Human Happiness Index. We expect to see a relationship between happier countries and more developed countries. There are several different variables that could contribute to a higher happiness or development ranking, so we have created four visuals with some of these factors. We also recognize that these variables can be highly subjective such as perceived generosity, so we have taken the most objective approach that we could.

Our first visual is a scatterplot depicting the relationship between the Human Development Rank and average life expectancy per country. As one might expect, the more developed countries tend to have a higher life expectancy on average. This is an example of a more intuitive aspect of what goes into a "good society." Generally speaking, everyone would like to live for as long as they can and so these types of factors do lead to more perceived happiness on average, so we have included this as a quantifiable aspect to such a subjective topic. Our second visual compares the Human Development Index rankings with the Human Happiness Index rankings, showing a positive correlation. This means that in general, the HHI and HDI ranks are the same numbers for both datasets. For example, Finland is in the top ten for each list. There are some notable outliers like Costa Rica and Mexico which fall lower on the HDI rankings, but are in the top twenty for the HHI. Outliers can be explained on the basis on subjectivity, meaning that not everyone has the same factors for what makes them happy. 

For our next visual, we plan to create a heat map showing the top twenty countries for both the HDI and HHI, with HDI in blue and HHI in red, with countries that are both in the top twenty being purple.
